## Reflection
This project was completed at the end of my 11th week atthe University of Birmingham bootcamp in FE web dev. 

The main goal of this project was to apply the knowledge gained working with node.js and specifically inquirer package,during the week. 

I had little or no challege in executing each of the acceptance criteria for this project. The most enjoyable part was researching to obtain little pieces of information to manipulate markdown files; such as how to create a badge in readme.md fie, how to add a block of code in readme file, how to add line breaks etc. 

In summary, as a result of this project, I have improved my knowledge of the inquirer package and gained new techniques in formatting markdown files. 

## Upcoming (New) Features
In the immediate future, I plan to include the following features to extend the functonality and UI/UX of this CLI app.

1. Images that illustrates the headings and gives the readme file more elegant visual
2. More badges, such as a download badge; to allow the user monitor the amount of the public's engagement with their project.
